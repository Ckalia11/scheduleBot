# uwBot
A chatbot that helps University of Waterloo students find out campus information easier.

I have recently taken a keen interest in conversational AI. I have also found it bothersome scavenging through webpages looking for information about my courses, events, and general questions about the university. I thought it might be interesting to create an a mobile app that students can use to easily lookup general and person-specific data. Ofcourse, it would be even cooler if they could just ask any question, and get back a useful response. This is what I am to achieve in this project.

Example use cases:
  1. How many students have enrolled for SYDE 572?
  2. What time is there recreational badminton at CIF?
  3. What day and time is my physics exam?
  4. Are there any holidays this term?
  5. How well is my upcoming course rated by other students?
